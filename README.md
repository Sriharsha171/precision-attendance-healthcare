# precision-attendance-healthcare
A smart, hygienic, and accurate facial recognition attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and KNN. Designed for healthcare environments to ensure secure, real-time staff tracking.

A contactless facial recognition-based attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Designed specifically for healthcare environments to enhance hygiene, accuracy, and real-time attendance tracking.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is designed to run exclusively on a **Raspberry Pi** setup with a connected camera module.


## 👨‍⚕️ Problem Statement
Manual attendance systems in hospitals can be error-prone, unhygienic, and time-consuming. This system replaces traditional methods with a facial recognition solution that offers speed, accuracy, and hygiene — essential in clinical settings.



## 🧪 Features
Real-time facial recognition using camera

Contactless attendance logging

Doctor-specific schedule popup

GUI for data collection and monitoring

Data stored in central database or local file
